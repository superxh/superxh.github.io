    <p>My name is Hang Xu. I am an electronic and electrical engineer with practical experience and research projects in integrated mechatronic and hardware system design. My interest fields are sensors, embedded computing, signal processing, control system, and robotics. I love engineering and enjoy the process of solving practical engineering problems. Here is my <a href="https://superxh.github.io/CV.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>I will hopefully receive my Master's in Science (MSc) degree in <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;id=882">Sensor and Imaging Systems</a> by the end of 2020 from the University of Glasgow (jointly by the University of Edinburgh). My MSc project <em>Inverted Pendulum Experiment for Simulated Laboratories</em> was supervised by <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-timothy-drysdale">Prof Tim Drysdale</a> from the University of Edinburgh. I obtained my undergraduate first-class honors degree in <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/eese/electronic-electrical-engineering.aspx">Electronic and Electrical Engineering</a> at the University of Birmingham. The final year project <em>Underground Utility Surveying using Extremely Low frequency (ELF) Signals-of-Opportunity</em> was supervised by <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/atkins-phil.aspx">Mr. Phil Atkins</a>, who gave me the golden opportunity to take part in his research group in the summer and led me into practical engineering. </p>
