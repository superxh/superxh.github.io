Thanks to Github pages and Pelican, now I get a personal blog here. In the following days, I will work on to regenerate all my past projects contents and begin to update the contents of my current life. 

For this blog, what I am going to do is to add the following feature:

- RSS subscription
- Translation feature
- Favicon
- A better *About* page (more info to go)
- A more organised *Tags* page
