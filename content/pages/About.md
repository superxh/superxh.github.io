Title: About

My name is Hang Xu. I am an electronic and electrical engineer with practical experience and research projects in integrated mechatronic and hardware system design. My interest fields are sensors, embedded computing, signal processing, control system, and robotics. I love engineering and enjoy the process of solving practical engineering problems. Here is my [CV](https://superxh.github.io/CV.pdf).

I will hopefully receive my Master's in Science (MSc) degree in [Sensor and Imaging Systems](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&id=882) by the end of 2020 from the University of Glasgow (jointly by the University of Edinburgh). My MSc project *Inverted Pendulum Experiment for Simulated Laboratories* was supervised by [Prof Tim Drysdale](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-timothy-drysdale) from the University of Edinburgh. I obtained my undergraduate first-class honors degree in [Electronic and Electrical Engineering](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/eese/electronic-electrical-engineering.aspx) at the University of Birmingham. The final year project *Underground Utility Surveying using Extremely Low frequency (ELF) Signals-of-Opportunity* was supervised by [Mr. Phil Atkins](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/eese/atkins-phil.aspx), who gave me the golden opportunity to take part in his research group in the summer and led me into practical engineering.
